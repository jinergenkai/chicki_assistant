The following parts are not yet done for a production-ready wakeword feature:
  Real microphone/audio stream integration in the isolate (currently simulated).
  Actual wakeword model (Porcupine/Sherpa) detection logic in the isolate.
  Platform-specific background/foreground service handling for Android and iOS.
  Robust error handling, resource cleanup, and configuration management.
  UI feedback and user permission flows for background audio/mic.
  Unit and integration tests for the wakeword pipeline.
